                            This project served as my internship assignment at Whirlpool Corporation. Within Whirlpool's Yummly 
                            brand, a substantial recipe catalog awaited transformation into a structured JSON guided recipe format. 
                            The existing process involved manual translation and integration of temperature data, leading to 
                            inefficiencies. My mission? Develop an automated tool for seamless conversion of Yummly recipes 
                            from word document to JSON while seamlessly integrating temperature data. This innovation streamlines 
                            the testing process, enabling the food science team to promptly validate recipes for the guided recipe scheme. 
                            Additionally, I had the privilege to propose conceptual design enhancements, fostering an even 
                            more streamlined workflow.

                            On this project, I leveraged a diverse tech stack, including Python, Dart/Flutter, JSON, AWS caching, 
                            and generative AI (text-davinci-003 model). My role also demanded proficiency in working with various 
                            APIs. Beyond technical skills, I applied my expertise in data analysis and presentation, critical 
                            thinking, and problem-solving. Collaborating with a globally dispersed team spanning Italy, China, 
                            and the USA enriched my experience, fostering effective cross-cultural teamwork.

                            I collaborated with two fellow students in my Computational Statistics class on this project, where 
                            our objective was to identify the primary road conditions influencing car accident severity in the Midwest. Our 
                            analysis utilized the real-time <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents">US Accidents dataset</a> spanning 2016-2023, gathered from various 
                            traffic APIs. We primarily employed the R programming language for this project.

                            We employed SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) with six factors, and our results indicated that Time 
                            of Day, Driver Sight, Thunderstorm, Junction, and Humidity were statistically significant contributors
                             to accident severity in the Midwest. Notably, Time of Day (morning, evening) exhibited the most 
                             substantial impact on accident severity. Upon deeper investigation, we found that Temperature 
                             primarily drove the Time of Day variable. This underscores the significant influence of temperature 
                             variations throughout the day on accident severity.

                            We recommended the implementation of targeted interventions during high-risk time periods as a potential 
                            strategy to mitigate accident severity. These interventions might include measures to improve visibility, 
                            stricter enforcement of traffic regulations, and public awareness campaigns, particularly during peak 
                            periods like the evening rush hour.

                            Rewriting the Code's 48-hour Black Wings Hacks hackathon in February 2023. <span class="italic">In the Art</span>
                            is a website for an art community, meant to connect creatives in the art space (painters, sculptors, musicians, dancers etc) from underrepresented communities 
                            through community-centered events. We created <span class="italic">In the Art</span> because of the lack of easily
                            accessible art education/programs in these communities.

                            We created the website using one of Major League Hacking's developer tools, Velo by Wix. which saved us
                            time as we didn't have to build the website from scratch. We also used MongoDB, Python, Postman APIs.

                            This project won the Honorable Mention prize at this hackathon, which as first-time hackers was quite
                            an accomplishment for us. We were also particularly proud of creating something that gives back to our
                            communities.
